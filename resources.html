You can also try creating or watching codecasts which is basically a recording of whatever code is typed in the code editors. This way other people can "playback" your recording in a video style and learn how the creation was developed.

It uses -prefix-free, so that you won't have to add any prefixes in your CSS code. You can save your work in Github gists, embed it in other websites and share it with others. It currently only supports modern versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox but I'm hoping to expand browser support soon.
